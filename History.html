						In 2013, Manila's Cookie started with the goal to make and serve the freshest and most delicious cookies to satistify every customers cookie cravings. 
						The brand believed that since cookies are the perfect portion size and they’re so easy to take on the go, it is the best and perfect dessert for people to buy and share. 
						According to them, unlike other desserts, cookies do not require additional utensils or tableware. Simply pick up and enjoy.
						The classic chocolate chip was the first product that was made and sold.

						</div>
					<p>
						The recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, 
						both brown and white sugar, semi-sweet chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla. They tried and tested formula of delivering great-tasting cookie until they 
						successfully got the right and exact flavor. That was the time their brand was born. 
						
						
						In 2015, the first Manila's Cookie franchise opened. Since then, the brand has grown to more than 50+ shop in the Philippines.

						and making them to fit our own tastes and to have a true impact on every cookie that is served to every costumer. In addition, Manila's Cookie 
						offers a new lineup of soft chewy cookies, including oreo cheesecake, matcha, almond, peanut butter and more delicious baked goods.

							we offer. We offer our cookies for a very affordable price. With the quality
							and taste of our cookies, people really get their money’s worth. As the 
							owner, I’m the one in charge with everything. I bake cookies, do marketing 
							promotions that’ll engage more people to try and recognize our business. 
							I also build a client base, and find a forum where my cookies would reach a 
							wide audience. I am also the one in charge to answer customers inquiries, do 
							product shoots etc."

							Manila's Cookie started in 2013, owned by Riz Allyson Aranas. 
							"In my lifetime, I have faced many obstacles, the largest of which pushed 
							me to the edge so hard that I felt I would never get up again. Oddly enough, 
							it was through that obstacle that I discovered my true calling and created a 
							small cookie business that was successful beyond what I had ever thought 
							possible. We also decided to build this business because cookies hold a lot 
							of nostalgia for people."
